# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

the goal of this project was to find better ways to predic myopia, or nearsightedness.  I explored the possibility using unsupervised learning to find out if there were distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. After being provided with raw data, I processed it to fit the machine learning models. I then used several clustering algorithms to explore whether or not the patients could be placed into distinct groups. Next, I created a visualization to share the findings. For Part 1, I Prepared the Data. First, I read the myopia.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame. Next, I removed the "MYOPIC" column from the dataset. Then, I standardized my dataset so that columns that contain larger values do not influence the outcome more than columns with smaller values. Next, for Part 2, I applied Dimensionality Reduction. First, I performed dimensionality reduction with PCA. Next, I further reduced the dataset dimensions with t-SNE and visually inspected the results. To do this, I ran a t-SNE on the principal components, which is the output of the PCA transformation. Then, I created a scatter plot of the t-SNE output. For Part 3, I performed a Cluster Analysis with K-means. I created an elbow plot to identify the best number of clusters. Lastly, for Part 4, I made a recommendation on whether or not the patients can be clustered.
